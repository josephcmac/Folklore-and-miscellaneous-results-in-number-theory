# Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-number-theory

This is a repository for formal verification of proofs of number-theoretic results which can be cassified as folklore or miscellaneous. We will use Isabelle as proof assistant.

Definition (folklore): A result which is well-known in a particular field, but it is hard to find a proof in the literature.

Definition (miscellaneous): A result which is hard to classify into a given area of a field.

Collaborations are welcome.
