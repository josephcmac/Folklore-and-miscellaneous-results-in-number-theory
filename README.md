# Folklore-and-miscellaneous-results-in-number-theory

This is a repository for formal verification of proofs of number-theoretic results which can be cassified as folklore or miscellaneous. We will use Isabelle as proof assistant.

Definition (folklore): A result which is well-known in a particular field, but it is hard to find a proof in the literature.

Definition (miscellaneous): A result which is hard to classify into a given area of a field.

The goal of this repository is to submit the thy files to Archives of Formal Proofs.

Collaborations are welcome (please, always include the name of the author in each thy file).
